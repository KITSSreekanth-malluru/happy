bThis directory contains data files for storing passivated session EJB
instances.  These files are maintained automatically by Dynamo, and
should not require administrative intervention.  However, if
necessary, files may be removed from this directory, with the effect
that the passivated EJB's stored in those files will be destroyed.
Under no circumstances should files be added, removed, or modified in
this directory while Dynamo is running.

Each running Dynamo instance should have its own directory for storing
passivated EJB instances.  If multiple servers are being run from the
same Dynamo installation (using the "servername" form of the
startDynamo command), then the
{DYNAMO_HOME}/home/servers/{servername}/sessionswap directory should
be used.  Otherwise, the {DYNAMO_HOME}/home/sessionswap directory
should be used.
