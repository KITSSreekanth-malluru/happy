	When all the above steps are successful, the popin is ready to go live.


Here is a brief explanation about the popup working at our end.
----------------------------------------------------------------

	1> stealth.htm

	This is the stealth window (minimized). This functions as a tracker for the Exit Survey.
	This stealth window will originate from the sitecrm directory on http://www.castorama.fr/sitecrm/...
	This window works in stealth mode and is not visible to the user in expanded form. Once the code
	in this window detects the time specified on the intercept.js is reached, it will self
	destruct and display the Exit Survey Invitation Window (exit.htm).

	2> exit.htm 

	This is the invitation for exit survey. exit.htm window will originate from the sitecrm directory on 
	http://www.castorama.fr/sitecrm/. When the user clicks 'Take Survey' , the survey will originate from
	crmmetrix Server and managed at our end.

	3>intercep.js
	This Javascript file contains of necessary informations to activate the popin, the interception rate and the size of the window.
